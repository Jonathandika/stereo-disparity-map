# Stereo Disparity Map

This project aims to generate a stereo disparity map using deep learing method (HitNet). The disparity map provides information about the depth of objects in a scene captured by a stereo camera setup.


This project is inspired by the work of [HitNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.12140).
